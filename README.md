# Tableau-Dashboard-Flight-Analysis

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set.

I am analyzing total number of passengers travelled from Luxembourg to different countries across Europe over different months from September 2019 to October 2020.
It is interactive dashboards built using maps, creating calculated fields makepoint, makeline, path and diffrent visualizations. 
We can have an insight from the dashboard thr most paseengers travelled in the month October 2019 and lowerst in March 2020 hence the airport was busiest in October 2019. 40 percent of total passengers have visited spain in the same year making it most popular destination and 1.5% have visited France being least favorite destination. During winters Feb 2021 there were no passengers visiting to Greece and Bulgaria, due to winters.
